# D2Forge

A collection of tools related to crafting for Diablo II.
Only uses data from Project Diablo 2, if there is interest I may update this project for vanilla and other mods as well.

The Crafted Items page covers crafting items using the Horadric Cube
The Affixes page holds a filterable list of all possible affixes for any item
